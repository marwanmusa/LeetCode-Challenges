    Task:
    A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

    Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
    If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

    You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words,
    an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
