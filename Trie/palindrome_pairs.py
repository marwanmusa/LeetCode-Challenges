"""
You are given a 0-indexed array of unique strings words.

A palindrome pair is a pair of integers (i, j) such that:
    - 0 <= i, j < words.length,
    - i != j, and
    - words[i] + words[j] (the concatenation of the two strings) is a palindrome.
Return an array of all the palindrome pairs of words.

You must write an algorithm with O(sum of words[i].length) runtime complexity.
"""


class Solution:
    """
    check each word for prefixes (and suffixes) that are themselves palindromes.
    If you find a prefix that is a valid palindrome, then the suffix reversed can be paired
    with the wordin order to make a palindrome.
    
    It's better explained with an example.
